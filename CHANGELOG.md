# Changelog

## Unreleased — Dagger-only control plane

### Added

- Reusable `portfolio-foundation` and `cloudflare-pages` Dagger modules for exact source
  identity, repository safety, deterministic artifact evidence, exact-green authorization,
  and fail-closed Pages delivery.
- An exact-SHA dependency policy and generated-client composition fixtures for both Python and
  TypeScript consumers, including isolated cold-engine proof. This change creates no package,
  version tag, or registry release.
- A typed Dagger module for central quality, dependency, workflow-security, secret, and
  fleet-policy checks.
- An authoritative GitHub evidence adapter that fails closed on unreadable source,
  effective branch protection, exact-SHA checks, or CodeQL metadata.
- Behavioral policy for thin pinned Dagger ingress and the two narrow artifact transport
  and source-free OIDC publisher exceptions.
- Hosted fleet scanning against exact `main` identities for all seven consumers and
  this repository.
- Regression coverage for explicit Workspace source, generated SDK separation, typed
  Secrets, app-bound protection, stale checks, privileged publishers, and incomplete API
  evidence.

### Changed

- GitHub Actions is now pinned event transport only. Repository-authored execution runs
  inside Dagger.
- Scheduled dependency/security work and full-history secret scanning run in Dagger.
- Branch protection converges on strict, app-bound, sole `Dagger`.

### Removed

- Seven legacy reusable workflows.
- Five composite-action packages.
- Seventeen consumer example workflows.
- The Ruby/shell classifier, fingerprint allowlists, example-fidelity stack, and their
  legacy security workflow.
- All remaining consumer execution references to `hseshadr/ci`.

Older reusable-workflow releases remain available in Git history and existing tags. They
are retired and are not part of the current architecture.
